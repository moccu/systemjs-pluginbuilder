## Contribution

Feel free to contribute. Please run all the tests and validation tasks before
you offer a pull request.

### Tests & validation

Run ```grunt validate test``` to run the tests and validation tasks.

### Readme

The readme chapters are located in the _docs_ directory as Markdown. All
Markdown files will be concatenated through a grunt task ```'docs'```. Call
```grunt docs``` to only update the ```README.md```. Run ```grunt``` to run
validation, tests and update the ```README.md``.

**Note:** Do not edit the _README.md_ directly, it will be overwritten!
