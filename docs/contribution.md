## Contribution

Feel free to contribute. Please run all the tests and validation tasks before
you offer a pull request.

### Tests & validation

Run ```grunt validate test``` to run the tests and validation tasks.

### Readme

The readme chapters are located in the _docs_ directory as Markdown. All
Markdown files will be concatenated through a grunt task ```'docs'```. Call
```grunt docs``` or run the complete task ```grunt``` to validate, test and
update the _README.md_.

**Note:** Do not edit the _README.md_ directly, it will be overwritten!
